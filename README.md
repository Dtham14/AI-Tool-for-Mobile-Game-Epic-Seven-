# Draft Assister for Epic Seven

## Description

This project was created for an Artifical Intellegence class at Simon Fraser University (CMPT 419).  It uses match data collected from the official Epic Seven match history API to create a dataset of matches.  Using the dataset, users are able to 
be provided suggestions on which heroes to pick in their draft.  When the draft is filled out, it will be fed into a linear regression model to predict an outcome whether the user's draft or the opponent's draft will win or lose.
