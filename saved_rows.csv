In order for us to be the best defense that we want to be at the end of this year, we have to keep putting together those type of performances.
I love it ‚Äì every down, every play.
Jobs and futures are on the line.
The rookie safety once again had six tackles, this time adding two passes defensed and an interception.
Today for example, it was 60-plus degrees at practice for a playoff game..
When someone looks at you, you don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre calling your name, you don‚Äôt know ‚Äì ‚ÄòOh, someone fumbled.‚Äô I think those things are going to have to be really worked through, because communication is so important to the game.
He‚Äôs running as fast as I‚Äôve ever seen him right now, running and playing.
Hill fielded the punt and returned it to midfield, giving Kansas City good field position to try to cut into the Bucs‚Äô 31 lead.
Since 1960, the win-loss record for interim head coaches in their first game was .
But, you‚Äôve still got to chase him around you‚Äôve got to plaster down the field.
Then there‚Äôs this: If, as his work on the practice field suggests, Gay can be a real weapon from long range, that too will make a big impact on the team in 2019.
Here, the Dolphins trade up five spots from 36 to 31, which is the exact trade the Buccaneers made in 2012 to get Doug Martin.
I‚Äôve got a lot of respect for the coaches around this league ‚Äì there‚Äôs some very good customize your own jersey around this league and I know we‚Äôve all got to put the work football jersey designs If that means no catches, it means no catches.
So stay with me on this and think a little bit about what Jason Licht said last week: The Bucs can afford to take a developmental player at any position, and they‚Äôre going to be basing the decision on which player will be the best two years from now.
And the consistency may simply be due to continuity and a multitude of experience on the roster.
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd call it relief, but there is a weight off my shoulders. difference.
Although Sutton is an All-Pro, I think these guys are great receivers, so we have our hands full.

The Dutch language Wikipedia will be turning 15 in June 2016. The Dutch Chapter, WMNL, will be in charge of the celebrations.
There will not be any special events organised in January, but there is a New Year's meet & drink at Museum Catharijneconvent, Utrecht on Saturday 16 January 2016. During the event we will take a short moment to raise a glass to the 15th birthday of Wikipedia.
The program includes a tour of the museum's highlights, possibly the awards ceremony of the Dutch writing contest, the awards ceremony of the Dutch WikiOwls to projects and users which are most valued by the community. We'll conclude the event with a typically Dutch ""borrel"" (drinks and chatting).

Visit these pages to learn about specific mental illnesses! Each page has text that will help you learn more about different illnesses. There will even be videos and stories along the way!
What Causes Mental Illness?
Mental illnesses are invisible illnesses that are inside the brain. They are common. About 1 in 4 people have one.
Mental illnesses are complicated. They don‚Äôt usually have just one cause. And no one knows for sure who will get a mental illness. Scientists have tried for hundreds of years to understand what causes mental illnesses. They found that if you have a family member with a mental illness, you are more likely to get one. This does not mean that you will get one for sure. And there are many ways to avoid mental illnesses.
- The most common mental illness is depression.
Doctors and therapists help people treat and avoid mental illnesses. You can avoid mental illnesses by learning certain skills. Recognizing mental health problems is one skill. Another skill is learning how to cope when you are feeling sad. Knowing who to call for help can also be important. Risk factors increase the chance of getting a mental illness. These are bad things like drugs, alcohol, and violence. Staying away from these things can help you avoid mental illnesses.
Is Mental Illness Contagious?
No mental illness is known to be contagious. This means that you cannot ‚Äúcatch‚Äù mental illness by being near someone who has a mental illness. You can‚Äôt catch it by kissing or hugging people with it either. Sometimes, it can be stressful to live with a person who has a mental illness. But, this does not mean that you are ‚Äúcatching‚Äù the illness.",https://mhiteens.org/Learn/,2021-06-12 17:20:46,CC-MAIN-2021-25,1623487586239.2,[]
"USA Network is remaking the classic 70s detective series Kojak with Ving Rhames in the role of the detective made famous by Telly Savalas.
The new series, updated for the 21st Century, portrays Theo Kojak as the son of a jazz musician and a doggedly determnied NYPD detective. Chazz Palminteri plays Kojak's former partner and present boss, Capt. Frank McNeil.
Considering the track record of excellent original cable series over the past few years (The Shield, Nip/Tuck, Monk, Battlestar Galactica), I'll be more than happy to give the new series a try.
The two-hour pilot airs Friday night at 9 ET on USA.
I wish I had cable. I've always liked Rhames, and Kojak was very enjoyable in its time. Hard actor to follow, but I'd watch it too.Posted by: Nick Queen at March 21, 2005 04:54 PM

"Seems like advice that would apply to many efforts. Not an extremely high bar to jump over. Those of us that write certainly don‚Äôt want to, suck that is. Same for bus drivers, cops, teachers and cooks. One of my flight instructors told me, ‚ÄúFlying is not all that difficult when everything is going as it should. The test of a real pilot is surviving when it turns to crap, don‚Äôt create problems‚Äù. So training, planning, checking and paying attention all help. We all need to apply that to what we do. But perhaps it is just a tad more critical when you‚Äôre 5000 feet over rugged terrain and need to pull over to find out what all those warning lights on the panel mean.

I‚Äôve always had a preference to aircraft that are capable of gliding. That one last hope is reassuring. Needless to say, I am not happy being strapped into a steel tube; flanked by two jet engines and a huge supply of high octane fuel; hurtling through ‚Äúsemi‚Äùspace at 350mph! No‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Neither do I. It‚Äôs a control thing. I never had any fear while flying sailplanes. I preflighted the aircraft and controlled the movement. But now I don‚Äôt know who is up front in the cockpit and commercial jets break sometimes. The odds are that it will all go well, but‚Ä¶

Yes it is a control thing. In my case, I know the airlines are profit driven; large enough to make effective management difficult; manned by people some of whom may not be the most responsible, and so the list goes on. There have been so many incidents which were attributed to one man‚Äôs oversight and/or carelessness that the overall airline industry does not inspire me with confidence.

"Collections are Things of the Past
There is a fine, fine line between hoarding and collecting. People hoard as a form of overcompensation to subconsciously convince themselves that they are prepared for whatever is to come. Maybe they‚Äôre afraid of letting go, or maybe they‚Äôre simply slothish and refuse to clean up. Contrarily, collections are a way of cherishing memories or moments or places in time. People collect things because it brings them joy and not a false sense of security. It provides an escape and gives them a glance at a past they want to past down from generation to generation. What do I collect? Spoons.
Souvenir spoons are fabulous. There are other types of collections; coins, stamps, postcards, playbills, baseball cards, thimbles, insects‚Ä¶ the list goes on. Being a proud owner of a spoon collection myself, however, I‚Äôll briefly cover some basics. Hopefully this will serve as an incentive for you to start your very own stock of an item of your choice. That‚Äôs the best part of this hobby; there‚Äôs literally something for everyone.
With spoons, the best time to add to your collection is during travel. Seeing that travel is pretty limited for the moment, it‚Äôs nice to look back at all of the places that I‚Äôve been. There is some maintenance involved in this hobby of mine, however. Most spoons are sterling silver, meaning that they have to be polished annually to avoid tarnish. It can get a bit tedious if you have a large collection, but the results are well worth it.
Maybe spoons aren‚Äôt your thing; that‚Äôs perfectly reasonable. But there is so much more out there. Some collections are treasured, sentimental items. Others are just reminders of places or moments or people. Most have extremely low maintenance, and they will come to mean so much more to you than whatever you may have originally bought them for. Collections can only grow over time, be it in worth or in value. Take, for example, my spoon collection again. I inherited many of my spoons from my mother who had collected them herself as a kid. Now I‚Äôve almost doubled our stock. She gets joy out of seeing her cherished spoons upheld, and I‚Äôm a happy conservationist so long as she funds my souvenir spoon-buying endeavors.
When I said that collections can go up in value overtime, I wasn‚Äôt kidding. Some people, such as myself, collect as a hobby and don‚Äôt plan on selling their things. However, many others decide to invest. Most spoons sell from between $7.50 and $11.00. Salem Witch Spoons, the souvenir spoons said to have started off the hobby, typically sell for at least ten times that amount in just 2020. In another ten years, the price will go up even more. So long as you keep good care of your collection, there‚Äôs going to be a market for it somewhere.
We don‚Äôt have much to hold onto at the moment. Vacation plans have been moved, so you might think there isn‚Äôt anything you could possibly start collecting now. This is where I encourage you to think again and look around your house. If you‚Äôre passionate about something, there‚Äôs a chance that you have a lot of things related to it. When compiled together, those similar objects can become quite the collection indeed. You will learn to appreciate them and the stories behind them more than before.
In the end, it doesn‚Äôt have to be a spoon. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be a thing. If you really are determined, you will find something that appeals to you enough to save forever. Start now, and your memories will outlast even the collection itself.

"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about trust lately. As we engage people at the margins, it‚Äôs striking how often trust is at the heart of the dynamic: Don‚Äôt trust the Gypsies ‚Äì hide your wallet. Don‚Äôt trust the white man, he‚Äôs out to rip you off. Don‚Äôt trust the American, he‚Äôs a spy. Don‚Äôt trust the Muslim, he could turn radical. Don‚Äôt trust that Christian, he‚Äôs just out to convert you. Don‚Äôt trust that disabled person, he‚Äôll just want even more special treatment. We who are closer to the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù (in terms of power, privilege, influence) tend not to trust those at the margins. And those on the margins trust us even less. If we don‚Äôt learn to build trust, we will never have the relational framework for the things we dream about.
We can‚Äôt build communities of faith, plant churches, foster community transformation without developing and nurturing trust. We have seen networks of gifted leaders among the marginalized in Europe, stepping up to use their gifts. But one of the biggest barriers seems to be the lack of an environment of trust. Thus, one leader will not come forward to suggest a project for funding, out of fear that another might take the idea and get the funding instead. Many issues that sound like questions of power (‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be part of this network unless my people are in the driver‚Äôs seat.‚Äù) are often more about trust. The underlying assumption is that I can trust ‚Äúmy‚Äù people‚Ä¶ those others, we‚Äôre not so sure
about them‚Ä¶
Trust, like water, is something that is part of everyday life, but can almost go unnoticed‚Ä¶ until it‚Äôs missing.
As we arrived at our hotel in Cyprus, it was made clear to us (multiple times from multiple staff persons in multiple ways) that we should not drink the water. Most certainly, they were thinking that we, being Americans, would likely assume that the water was, in fact, drinkable ‚Äì and thus be inclined to make the mistake of ingesting it.
Having lived in Ukraine for years has a different effect on one. Often, even in places where it is not an issue, I, through force of habit as much as anything, ask whether the water is, in fact, safe to drink. I‚Äôve done this even though, on more than one occasion, it was clear that the very asking of such a question is interpreted as in some way being ignorant or insensitive. Had the Cypriot hotel staff not said a WORD about the tap water, there would have been no way in the world I‚Äôd ever dare to even sip it‚Ä¶
In America, we have learned to trust whatever mechanism it is that is behind our tap that is responsible for supplying water, a necessary element of everyday life. Despite the fact that few if any of us could explain the mechanisms involved even if our lives depended on it.
In Ukraine, however, we learned to distrust that which was behind the kitchen tap. In essence, living in Ukraine for a long time leads to the development of a ‚Äòdefault assumption‚Äô that tap water is not something that one considers as safe to drink.
The response of the hotel was to offer our group bottled water ‚Äì a fairly common practice in many of the places we‚Äôve traveled. This time, though, it was offered as ‚Äúan amenity‚Äù ‚Äì we didn‚Äôt even have to pay for it. Maybe because the tap water was SO not safe to drink‚Ä¶ or maybe because they thought we‚Äôd be impressed by their sensitivity.
Having been given an allotment of plastic bottles, I stepped over to our group, which was coalescing in an atrium area. ‚ÄúWho wants one?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThe staff says don‚Äôt drink-a da water.‚Äù Of course, everyone responded in the affirmative and readily accepted a bottle of sustenance.
It struck me that all three processes ‚Äì those behind the water from US and Ukrainian taps and from inside these plastic bottles ‚Äì were equally opaque to us. For all anyone knew or could prove, these plastic bottles were filled with water from the Cypriot tap. It certainly looked and smelled the same. I mentioned to my colleagues that they might want to exercise caution since there was no way of knowing that these bottles hadn‚Äôt been filled with undrinkable tap water. After all, we don‚Äôt know these people from anyone. Can we really trust them?
However, no one was moved to steps of verification‚Ä¶ They trusted the label on the plastic bottle, even though there was absolutely no visible physical difference between the liquid in the plastic bottle and that which came our of the tap. And they trusted the hotel staff, whom they had never met, to not be the sort of people that would tamper with another‚Äôs drinking water.
So what does this show us about trust and how we exercise it, to whom or to what it is extended?",https://millpondporch.com/2015/04/16/trust-and-drinking-water/,2021-06-12 17:20:05,CC-MAIN-2021-25,1623487586239.2,"[['https://millpondporch.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/ussr-soviet-anti-baptist-poster-1928.jpg?w=350&h=404', ""The Soviets were the best at distrust.

"Daniel H. Pink quotes: an all-you-can-eat buffet of biz and life advice.
‚ÄúWhen the reward is the activity itself‚Äîdeepening learning, delighting customers, doing one‚Äôs best‚Äîthere are no shortcuts.‚Äù
‚ÄúRewards can deliver a short-term boost. Just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few more hours. But the effect wears off, and, worse, can reduce a person‚Äôs longer-term motivation to continue the project.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy reach for something you can never fully attain? But it‚Äôs also a source of allure. Why not reach for it? The joy is in the pursuit more than the realization. In the end, mastery attracts precisely because mastery eludes.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat you decide not to do is probably more important than what you decide to do.‚Äù
‚ÄúStart planning how to achieve those top five goals. And the other twenty? Get rid of them.‚Äù
‚ÄúPersistence trumps talent..
Lack of persistence works the same way, only in the opposite direction.‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course talent is important, but the world is littered with talented people who didn‚Äôt persist, who didn‚Äôt put in the hours, who gave up too early, who thought they could ride on talent alone. Meanwhile, people who might have less talent pass them.‚Äù
‚ÄúMotivation 1.0 presumed that humans were biological creatures, struggling to obtain our basic needs for food, security and sex. Motivation 2.0 presumed that humans also responded to rewards and punishments. That worked fine for routine tasks but .‚Äù
‚ÄúThe most deeply motivated people‚Äînot to mention those who are most productive and satisfied‚Äîhitch their desires to a cause larger than themselves. Motivation.‚Äù
 have.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo what you can‚Äôt and experience the beauty of the mistakes you make.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe most successful people, the evidence shows, often aren‚Äôt directly pursuing conventional notions of success. They‚Äôre working hard and persisting through difficulties because of their internal desire to control their lives, learn about their world, and accomplish something that endures.‚Äù
‚ÄúInnovation and creativity are greatest when we are not at our best.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe most fulfilling jobs share a common trait: they prod us to work at our highest level but in a way that we, not someone else, control.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn the past, work was defined primarily by putting in time, and secondarily on getting results. We need to flip that model.‚Äù
‚ÄúPeople can have two different mindsets. Those with a ‚Äòfixed mindset‚Äô believe that their talents and abilities are carved in stone. Those with a ‚Äògrowth mindset‚Äô believe that their talents and abilities can be developed. Fixed mindsets see every encounter as a test of their worthiness. Growth mindsets see the same encounters as opportunities to improve.‚Äù
.‚Äù
‚ÄúAsking, ‚ÄòWhy?‚Äô can lead to understanding. Asking, ‚ÄòWhy not?‚Äô can lead to breakthroughs.‚Äù
‚ÄúGoals that people set for themselves and that are devoted to attaining mastery are usually healthy. But goals imposed by others‚Äîsales targets, quarterly returns, standardized test scores, and so on‚Äîcan sometimes have dangerous side effects.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf we stick with a task too long, we lose sight of the goal.‚Äù
‚ÄúControl leads to compliance; autonomy leads to engagement.‚Äù
‚ÄúAutonomy. Mastery. Purpose. These are the building blocks of [a] new way of doing things.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll of us want to be part of something bigger than ourselves; something that matters.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhenever I meet someone new, I always ask the same question: ‚ÄòSo, what do you do?'‚Äù
‚ÄúChange is inevitable, and when it happens, the wisest response is not to wail or whine but to suck it up and deal with it.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an idea out there that salespeople have actually been obliterated by the internet, which is just not supported by the facts.‚Äù
.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnytime you‚Äôre tempted to upsell someone else, stop what you‚Äôre doing and ‚Äòupserve‚Äô instead. Don‚Äôt try to increase what they can do for you. Elevate what you can do for them.‚Äù
.‚Äù
‚ÄúHire good people, and leave them alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúChildren who are praised for ‚Äòbeing smart‚Äô often believe that every encounter is a test of whether they really are.

‚ÄúExtroverts often stumble over themselves. They can talk too much and listen too little, which dulls their understanding of others‚Äô perspectives.

Abstract
Aims: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of the common mental health disorders associated with increased exposure to potentially traumatic events in career and volunteer firefighters, and to identify which individual, acute stressor, operational and organisational factors predict mental health outcomes. Method: Four Australian services participated in a prospective study, with 335 firefighters completing an online survey twice (12-months apart). The survey comprised demographic and fire service information, self-report measures for PTSD, depression, anxiety, alcohol use, exposure to personal trauma and life stressors, number and types of firefighter-related potentially traumatic events experienced in the previous 12-months, job satisfaction related to operational and organisational characteristics of their role, and a measure of the priority their fire service placed on their psychological wellbeing. Structured clinical interviews were conducted with a sample of survey respondents to assess for PTSD, depression, generalised anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder. Results: From 297 clinical interviews (91 career firefighters and 206 volunteer firefighters), 24% (n = 22) of the career firefighters met diagnosis for any psychiatric disorder. Of these, 3% met criteria for PTSD, 5% for depression, 4% for generalised anxiety disorder, and almost 12% for alcohol use disorder. The primary regression analyses indicated the following findings for the career firefighters. The main variable associated with each of the four disorders was the respective level of symptoms at baseline. In addition, exposure to more potentially traumatic events in the previous 12 months contributed to, and high job satisfaction associated with the operational aspects of their role protected them against the development of PTSD and depression. Finally, the findings indicated that experiencing more recent life events in the previous 12 months and rank (being a firefighter) contributed to more symptoms of Alcohol Use Disorder. From the interviews 17% (n = 35) of the volunteer firefighters met diagnosis for any psychiatric disorder. Of these, 2% met criteria for PTSD, 4% for depression, 5% for generalised anxiety disorder, and 6% for alcohol use disorder. The primary regression analyses indicated that the only predictor of PTSD, generalised anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder was the respective baseline level for each disorder. The main predictors of depression were baseline level of symptoms of depression and experiencing more recent life events in the previous 12 months. Conclusions: The relatively low prevalence rates for the career and volunteer firefighters in this study indicate their reasonably good mental health across the four disorders. The rates compare favourably with other firefighter studies and are comparable with the rates in the general population for most disorders. An exception to this was volunteer firefighters‚Äô high rate of alcohol dependence and low rate of PTSD. The findings indicate the importance of fire services developing cultures that support and encourage the early identification and management of symptoms and have systems in place to monitor the types of and frequency of firefighters‚Äô exposure to potentially traumatic events. Finally, particularly for the career firefighters, the findings highlight the protective nature of high job satisfaction associated with operational characteristics of their role and reduced mental health symptoms, and the importance for firefighters and managers to recognise and address reductions in job satisfaction.

"May 28, 2019
Good morning. It's overcast today with temps in the high fifties. Every now and then, the sun peeks in on us for a few minutes. According to the weather app on my phone, it should start raining soon, and rain the next four days.
So far, it's been a busy morning. I had to pay a batch of bills and have them ready for mailing before the mail carrier gets here. Now that it's done, I can rest easy till the next batch of bills is due.
Pogo and I enjoyed a lazy day yesterday. It was warm enough to sit out on the porch, and we did for a while, but the air was not good for breathing so we spent most of the day indoors. Some days my breathing is not as good as others. Yesterday was one of those days.
I did walk around the yard the other day to see what was blooming or getting ready to bloom. My roses bushes are just beginning to bud. Here are a few of the photos that I took.
I love taking photos of the raindrops on the plants and leaves. It rained the other night, so I took these photos the next morning. I just think it is amazing how all these little rain drops can sit on the leaves and not roll off. They glisten like diamonds.
Today I guess I'll work on the pink afghan. Later I'll take a photo of it to share. It really is pretty. This year, I'd like to make a couple of the great grandchildren's afghans. This should keep my hands pretty busy for the rest of the year. In between, I'm hoping to work on a couple new projects.
You say ""How is Windows 10 coming along?"" Slowly, very slowly. I'm taking my time with it, as long as I'm able to use my old laptop. However, I know that I need to learn it, so I will. Meanwhile, I'm getting my photos ready for next year's calendar while my old lap top is still working. I'll start working on my next Christmas card too. Just in case.
That's about all my news for this morning. So, till tomorrow, Y'all have a fantabulous day.
Hugs, Edna B.

We have over 6,000 fans at the Roots of Change fanpage, mostly through advertising on Facebook so we are believers. However, our experience is that members of a group have higher percent response rate when there is a call to action ‚Äì like filling out a survey. It‚Äôs pretty clear that‚Äôs a result of the fact that a message to group members shows up in the Inbox on Facebook, while a message to Fans shows up as a ‚Äúupdate‚Äù which in our experience has very little impact. Even when the fan message is combined with a fan page posting, the response rate from group members is higher.
So fan pages seem better for communication, but groups seem to be better for action.",https://mission-minded.com/pages-vs-groups-getting-more-from-facebook/,2021-06-12 17:40:36,CC-MAIN-2021-25,1623487586239.2,[]
"Sydney Bible Baptist College is off to a good first semester. God answered prayer with 13 full-time students and 18 part-time students. Additionally, there are another 90 students in the evening and extension school classes!
My course at college this year is New Testament Bible History Survey. Kathleen‚Äôs health situation requires me to miss some classes, but I really enjoy doing what I can. Please continue to pray for Kathleen and her struggle with Alzheimer‚Äôs and some other annoying physical symptoms that have plagued her for years and are now exacerbated. She is still a huge blessing helping me with matters of sight and hearing! We thank the Lord continually that He has allowed us to still have each other to help!
The Spanish translation of the Bible history survey books is progressing well. The Old Testament Guidebook is not quite half-done, and the New Testament Handbook is well over half-done!
Please join us in prayer for these matters:
-Where should we print and how can we effectively distribute the Spanish books? We are exploring one avenue right now and need the Lord‚Äôs firm direction.
-We need some special person who knows Spanish translation well and is also able to fit in the translation on powerpoint slides. We have the slides available in English and want to replace the text with Spanish. This will give us a library of powerpoint presentations for each of the 30 New Testament lessons. Later we‚Äôll see if it is expedient to do the same for the Old Testament lessons.
-Pray for our translators and formatter:
Pastor and Mrs. Marvin Robertson, Maria Esther Alvarez and her son Arturo
-Please pray for the upcoming summer ministry of the Christian camps/conferences in Beit Mendere in Lebanon. The political situation is of concern and we pray that it will not affect the summer ministry of the camp. Renovation work is currently in process in preparation for the summer ministries. Also, the Aaba church will be moving into their new church building which will be a great blessing. For some time they have been bounced around because of unrest in Tripoli where they were previously meeting on Sundays.
I would like to share with you an encouraging letter from a pastor who ran the Old Testament Bible History course (with the DVD lectures) for some keen laypeople in his church in Alabama. It has always been my vision and prayer that many churches would find a real help from these courses just as this pastor did below:
‚ÄúBrother Hester, Greetings in the wonderful Name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. We just wanted to let you know what a blessing the Old Testament History Bible Course was! About 15 of our church members completed the study last Thursday. Over the past months we have grown to love our time of study with you and always looked forward to ‚Äòour beloved historical outline!‚Äô Lord willing we will begin the New Testament History studies in August with more Christians that are hungry for the Word of God. Thank you for your service to our Lord.

"TransAct Insurance Company (TIC) is an automobile insurance company that provides insurance to customers in the Southeastern states. The board of directors hired a new president to improve the company‚Äôs competitive advantage and improve customer service. After assessing the situation he made some adjustments at the vice president level, which included replacing three vice presidents and hiring Jim Leon as vice president of claims (McShane ; Glinow, 2013). Jim, the new acting vice president, immediately jumped into action and visited their 50 claims centers and met with all the claims managers and directors. He uncovered some areas of concern with employee-manager relations. The morale was low and seemed to be due to the Jim and the new president discussed the situation and decided to commit to improving morale and supervisory leadership. His first change was to announce an open door policy for employees to approach him with matters they didn‚Äôt want to address with their supervisor, he also was able to overcome barriers within the company and form a flex-time program for A monument change that Jim was able to implement was the Claims Management Credo that outlined leadership styles he felt every claims manager should follow.

"Improved stability by up to 25%
The new geometry of the completely flat StarLITE HPC base is cleverly structured. Its new anti-rocking design is based on a 360-degree continuous contact surface which improves tilt angle and may be combined with structural ribs and oval push-up. ‚ÄúThe doubled sitting surface and the balanced stretching ratios between small and large sides enable better material distribution, while avoiding base sagging,‚Äù explains Laurent Naveau, Packaging expert at Sidel. This oval shape achieves an optimum performance level, drastically improving empty or filled container stability by up to 25%. This helps increase production uptime, with better container stability on conveyors in comparison with existing major flat PET container bases, and also improves consumer experience.
A more sustainable and cost-effective flat container
Applicable for both opaque and transparent PET resins, the StarLITE HPC base offers wide containers opportunities and is perfectly compliant with rPET up to 100%. The smart, asymmetric, structured base design improves material distribution, prevents unexpected base roll-out and contributes to lightweighting opportunities, i.e., a 0.5 g PET reduction for a 500 mL ontainer base. The enhanced base cooling engineering for mould and tooling design improves base cooling during blow moulding and may prevent post-mould base cooling according to bottle shape, format and weight.
Thanks to its design, the StarLITE HPC base is easy to blow and reduces blow moulding pressure by up to 10%, i.e., a 3 bar decrease for a 420 mL container. It also makes it possible to push the process speed limit even further and to increase production output up to 15% higher than the market average. For instance, a flat container produced at 1,600 bottles per hour per mould (b/h/m) with a standard market base can be blown up to 1,800 b/h/m with the StarLITE HPC base, with possibilities to reach up to 2,000 b/h/m according to bottle shape. With the investment in a new set of moulds equipped with the StarLITE HPC base, very fast payback in less than one year can be achieved, while drastically reducing GHG emissions.
This StarLITE HPC is compatible with all generations of Sidel blow moulding machines: SBO EvoBLOW, SBO Universal, SBO Series2 and SBO Series1.

"Restaurant Review: Jungle Juice

After reading a review on BlogTO, I then checked them out on Facebook. (PS and you should too). When I saw the photos that they were posting I knew I had to visit!!
It‚Äôs owned by a lovely Brazillian entrepreneur that only moved to Toronto five years ago. She was so passionate about cooking Brazilian food to her Canadian friends, that she opened up a small juice bar/restaurant.
I tried the ‚Äúcheese bread‚Äù (pao de queijo) and was instantly in love. One could definetly tell that it was not made with white flour and had a diffrerent taste and texture to it.
I also tried the special of the day which was scrambled eggs with cassava.
Next visit, I‚Äôm going to try a ‚Äúcleanser‚Äù which is ginger, apple, grapes, ice and water and a panini.(Brazilian style of course).
I also love the prices at Jungle Juice ‚Äì everything is under $8.00. My type of ‚Äúcheap and cheerful restaurant‚Äù.

"Have you ever bought something on somewhat of an impulse that you both cherish and regret? I sure as hell have! I love this piece to bits and I‚Äôm so proud I snagged it before I knew what I was doing, but my wallet still holds it partially responsible for this habit hobby.
Back in 2003, I‚Äôd toyed with the idea of buying a kimono for some time, due most likely to my paternal grandmother‚Äôs appreciation of Asian antiques and textiles. She‚Äôs not been with us for a very long time, but I‚Äôm sure she would heartily encourage this silly hobby. But I digress..
As I mentioned, I‚Äôd waffled with the idea but did essentially no research. A smart person would have probably started with a yukata or something, but I honestly had no idea of types, formality, eras, motifs, etc. I just saw this beast and fell head over heels. I had to have it.
It‚Äôs a gorgeous early-Showa era houmongi. The silk is thick and rich and delicious, and the design is sweeping streams of spider-style kiku in white with faint black and gold accents. The dramatic, graphic contrast is what drew me to it in the first place. The sleeves are long, not quite Taisho-era, but still elegant and draping, and the lining is a vivid red. I love the subtle black to grey yuzen dyeing on the leaves so much.
I‚Äôve paired it up with a black, red, and gold formal obi, but I‚Äôd like to try it with a softer, more vintage style at some point. Though, I have to say I love how it looks with the contrast of black, and how the red makes my skin and hair look. Is that conceited? XD

"It seems like nearly every Christian book I‚Äôve ever read that advocates a particular position plays the card of the ‚Äúearly church‚Äù.
THIS is how the early church did it. That‚Äôs a good reason why you should too. Let me give you a few verses from Acts or Ephesians and explain how they back up what I‚Äôm saying.
It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter what the position is either. Somehow the pure, spotless apostolic early church did it the right way.
- House churches? Early church dude!
- Lots of structure in your big church organization? Early church! (Deacons, bishops, apostles, presbytery meetings in Jerusalem, etc.)
- Lots of speaking in tongues? Early church. (All over the place.)
- Long teaching sermons that put people to sleep? Early church! (Paul and the guy who fell out the window)
- Infant baptism? Early church! (His whole household was baptised‚Ä¶)
- Immersion baptism? Early church! (They found a place where there was lots of water)
- Communism? Yes!
- High view of personal property rights? Yes!
- etc.
Now, some of these arguments are more dubious than others. Some of them aren‚Äôt bad in fact. But here, early on, Wright points out the obvious:
‚Ä¶the problem with all such theories is that they are themselves based on nothing more than elaborate guesswork. We simply do not know very much about the early church, and certainly not enough to make the kind of guesses that are on offer in this area. When traditio-historical study (the examination of hypothetical stages by which the written gospels came into existence) builds castles in the air, the ordinary historian need not feel a second-class citizen for refusing to rent space in them.
-N.T. Wright, The Resurrection of the Son of God, p.19
Wright is one of the brightest NT scholars ever. He knows as much about the early church as anyone you‚Äôre going to run into. And what does he know? ‚Äúnot very much‚Äù.
So, for example, I‚Äôm down with the idea of house churches, but can you really write a whole book (200-300 pages) on how to set up a house church and claim the bible AND history are backing up all your ideas? Seriously?

"OK. So these notes are just to help me remember a few things. They need a lot of context.
Here, ‚Äúmediator‚Äù is used to mean the one whose desires we are imitating. They are the model. We want to be like our father or mother. We want to be like that guitar-shredding rock star. We want to be beautiful like so-and-so. We want to be holy like that saint or that role-model. For better or worse, they are the gate-keeper of our desire once we‚Äôve made them our model.
At a certain depth there is no difference between our own secret and the secret of Others. Everything is revealed to the novelist when he penetrates this Self, a truer Self than that which each of us displays. This Self imitates constantly, on its knees before the mediator. This profound Self is also a universal Self, for everyone imitates constantly, everyone is on his knees before the mediator.
-Rene Girard, Deceit, Desire, and the Novel: Self and Other in Literary Structure, p.297
EVERYONE IMITATES, everyone is just the same: compared to the deep, dark secret unearthed by Freud‚Äôs Oedipus, the fearsome secret of patricide and incest, this secret seems disappointingly tame.
There is something seductive in Freud‚Äôs notion that the king‚Äôs ‚Äúdestiny moves us only because it might have been ours ‚Äì because the oracle laid the same curse upon us‚Äù Freud allows each of us to play the hero‚Äôs part in our own private drama. Girard, by contrasts, casts us in a decidedly unheroic posture, kneeling before the model whose desire we copy. It would be hard to imagine anything more humiliating than that. While incestuous and patricidal impulses are no doubt shameful, they also appear gratifyingly spontaneous, powerful, and extreme. In a world that places a premium on originality and authenticity, the most shameful thing for the Self may be to admit that it ‚Äúimitates constantly, on it‚Äôs knees before the mediator.‚Äù
-Mark R. Anspach, Imitating Oedipus, p. xxxvi
Ouch. ‚Äúimitates constantly, on it‚Äôs knees before the mediator‚Äù. This idea is SOOOO strongly resisted amongst artists. Imagine a young composer writing a piece of music. He wants to ‚Äúfind is own voice‚Äù. But what is he doing? It‚Äôs painfully obvious that he is imitating those who came before him at every freakin‚Äô turn.

"The bench will be eight feet long and made out of Southern Yellow Pine with my Emmert vise installed at the end. I‚Äôm going to try something that I‚Äôm not sure has ever been done before and build the legs and the stretchers out of pressure treated wood. I just like the idea of the added weight with pressure treated wood. Plus, I was able to buy 6√ó6‚Äôs for the legs and save some money verses buying more 2x stock and gluing them up to create a 5‚Äùx5‚Äù legs the way Chris does. I calculated how much material I need and bought (12) 2x10x8‚Äôs, (4) 2x12x8‚Äôs and (2) 6x6x8‚Äôs. The total cost was $132.00. Not bad considering I paid $150 for a piece of 8/4‚Äùx 8‚Äùx60‚Äù walnut when I built my Pennsylvania Secretary a few year ago. The reason I didn‚Äôt make the entire bench out of pressure treated lumber is because ACQ lumber is very corrosive to metal. You need to use hot dipped galvanized or stainless steel fasteners when working with it. Since my vise is cast iron, it would end up corroding if I used ACQ pressure treated lumber for the top.
After letting the lumber acclimate in my shop for about a week, I ripped the boards in half so that they would dry faster. My wimpy little table saw doesn‚Äôt have enough power to rip through 2x stock without binding, so I had to set the blade a little under ¬æ‚Äù high and make two passes, flipping the board over after the first pass. Due to the high moisture content some of the boards started to crook immediately once I took them off the table saw. Once the ripping was complete, I stickered all the boards to let them air dry for a couple of more weeks. Once dry I‚Äôll start milling them to size.
I don‚Äôt know how this bench will turn out using pressure treated lumber but I figure I can describe some of successes and pitfalls I encounter while building it.

"A reasonable choice might be the zero-one-inflated beta model
In psychological experiments, subjective responses are often collected using two types of response scales: ordinal and visual analog scales. These scales are unlikely to provide normally distributed data. However, researchers often analyze responses from these scales with models that assume normality of the data.1
Ordinal scales, of which binary ratings are a special case, provide ordinal data and are thus better analyzed using ordinal models (B√ºrkner and Vuorre 2019; Liddell and Kruschke 2018).
Analog scales, also known as slider scales, are also unlikely to provide normally distributed responses because the scale is bounded at the low and high ends. These responses also tend to be skewed. It is common for slider responses to bunch at either end of the slider scale, potentially making the deviation from normality more severe.
For example, Figure 1 shows a slider scale in action. (I found this random example with a simple internet search at). In experiments using slider scales, subjects are typically instructed to use their mouse to drag a response indicator along a horizontal line, and/or click with a mouse on a point of the scale that matches their subjective impression. Sometimes these responses are provided on paper, where subjects are asked to bisect a line at a point that matches their subjective feeling (e.g. halfway between ‚ÄúLeisure‚Äù and ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù if they are subjectively equally important.)
Figure 1: Example slider scale from
These analog ratings are sometimes thought to be ‚Äòbetter‚Äô than discrete ordinal ratings (Likert item responses) because of the greater resolution of the slider scale. The scale‚Äôs resolution is limited only by the resolution of the monitor: For example, if the rating scale is 100 pixels wide, there are 100 possible values for the ratings. It is not unthinkable that such ratings can be considered continuous between the low and high endpoints. However, they are often not well described by the normal distribution.
Consider Figure 2. This figure shows 200 simulated ratings on a [0, 1] slider scale (meaning that any value between 0 and 1, inclusive of the endpoints, is possible). I have also superimposed a blue curve of the best-fitting normal density on the histogram. The two most notable non-normal features of these data are that they are bounded at 0 and 1 where the data appears to ‚Äúbunch,‚Äù and (possibly) skewed. Of course, these data were simulated; experience with slider scales tells me, however, that this histogram is not unrepresentative of such ratings.
Figure 2: Histogram of 200 simulated slider scale ratings, with a superimposed best-fitting density curve from a normal distribution.
While the height of the blue curve is not comparable to the heights of the bars (one represents a density, the other counts of observations in rating bins), it should be apparent that features of the rating scale data make the blue normal curve a poor representation of the data.
First, the skew apparent in the data is not captured by the normal density curve. Second, and perhaps more important, the blue curve does not respect the 0 and 1 boundaries of the slider scale data.
Focus on this latter point: We can see that the blue curve assigns density to areas outside the possible values: The model predicts impossible values with alarming frequency. Second, the boundary values 0.0 and 1.0 do not receive any special treatment under the normal model, but we can see that the data are bunched at the boundaries. The great frequency of responses at 0.0 and 1.0 leads to large prediction errors from the normal model of these data.
In other words, (simulated) subjects tend to give many extreme ratings. This is especially apparent in the low end of the rating scale, where the continuous spread of scores tapers off, but then there is a large spike of ratings at zero. The normal model misses these features of the data, and may therefore lead to unrepresentative estimates of the data generating process, and even erroneous conclusions.
More generally, if your goal is to predict cognition and behavior (Yarkoni and Westfall 2017), a model that is obviously a poor representation of your data‚Äîin terms of having such a poor predictive utility‚Äîshould not be your first choice for data analysis.
Admittedly, the data in Figure 2 were simulated, and it remains an empirical question as to how common these features are in real data, and how severe these issues are to normal models (t-test, ANOVA, correlation, etc.).
Nevertheless, it would be desirable to have an accessible data-analytic model for slider scale data, whose assumption better match observed features of the data. Here, I introduce one such model‚Äîthe zero-one-inflated beta (ZOIB) model‚Äîand show how it can be applied to real data using the R package brms (B√ºrkner 2017b). I also compare this model to standard analyses of slider scale data and conclude that the ZOIB can provide more detailed and accurate inferences from data than its conventional counterparts.
Figure 3: Dr. John A. Zoidberg thinks you should try a ZOIB model on your slider scale data.
Above, we established‚Äîrather informally‚Äîthat normal models may be less than optimal for slider scale data. Of course, no model is the correct model of such data, but it would be desirable to use a model that best represents the data under study.
The model for analysis of slider scale data discussed here has been called the ‚Äúzero-one-inflated beta‚Äù model, or ZOIB (Liu and Kong 2015). It is a model of data in the closed [0, 1] interval, and has two components: A beta distribution for responses in the closed (0, 1) interval, and a bernoulli distribution for the binary {0, 1} responses. Under this model, predictors can affect either or both the continuous and binary responses, the proportion of binary responses, or the spread of the continuous ratings.
To understand ZOIB, let‚Äôs start with a closer look at the theoretical beta density.
The beta distribution used in beta regression (Ferrari and Cribari-Neto 2004) is a model of data in the open (0, 1) interval. (i.e. all values from 0 to 1, but not 0 and 1 themselves, are permitted.)
The beta distribution typically has two parameters, which in R are called
shape1 and
shape2. Together, they determine the location, spread, and skew of the distribution. Four example beta densities are shown in Figure 4. Using R‚Äôs
dbeta(), I drew four curves corresponding to beta densities with different
shape1 and
2 parameters.
Figure 4: Four examples of the beta density, corresponding to different shape parameters.
This default parameterization is useful, for example, as a prior distribution for proportions: The
shape1 and
shape2 parameters can define the prior number of zeros and ones, respectively. For example, in the above figure,
dbeta(x, shape1 = 1, shape2 = 1) results in a uniform prior over proportions, because the prior zeros and ones are 1 each.
However, for our purposes, it is more useful to parameterize the beta distribution with a mean and a precision. To convert the former parameterization to mean (which we‚Äôll call \(\mu\) (mu)) and precision (\(\phi\) (phi)), the following formulas can be used
\[ \mbox{shape1} = \mu \phi \\ \mbox{shape2} = (1 - \mu)\phi \]
(This parameterization is provided in R in the PropBeta functions from the extraDist package, which calls the precision parameter, or \(\phi\),
size.) Redrawing the figure from above with this parameterization using the
dprop() function, we get Figure 5.
Figure 5: Four examples of the reparameterized beta density (
dprop()).
Shown above are four density functions of the beta family, whose precision and mean are varied. The first (red line) is a beta distribution with precision = 1, and mean = 0.5. It results in a uniform distribution. If a subject gave random slider scale responses, they might look much like this distribution (any rating is equally probably as any other rating).
The second beta distribution (green line) has precision 10, and mean 0.2. It is heavily skewed to the right. The third distribution (teal line) has precision 10, and a mean of 0.9. The fourth one, most similar to a normal distribution, has precision 70 and mean 0.50 (purple line).
In beta regression, this family of distributions is used to model observations, and covariates can have effects on both the mean and precision parameters.
However, beta regression only allows outcomes in the open (0, 1) interval. We know that slider scales often result in a bunching of values at the boundaries, and these boundary values might be informative of the participants‚Äô cognition and behavior. To handle these extreme values, we can add a zero-one inflation process to the beta distribution.
The zero-one-inflated beta (ZOIB) adds a separate discrete process for the {0, 1} values, using two additional parameters. Following convention, we shall call them \(\alpha\) (alpha) and \(\gamma\) (gamma). These parameters describe the probability of an observation being a 0 or 1 (\(\alpha\)), and conditional on that, whether the observation was 1 (\(\gamma\)).
In other words, the model of outcomes under ZOIB is described by four parameters. The first is \(\alpha\), the probability that an observation is either 0 or 1. (Thus, \(1-\alpha\) is the probability of a non-boundary observation.) If an observation is not 0 or 1, the datum is described by the beta distribution with some mean \(\mu\) and precision \(\phi\). If an observation is 0 or 1, the probability of it being 1 is given by \(\gamma\) (just like your usual model of binary outcomes, e.g. logistic regression). So you can think of the model as a kind of mixture of beta and logistic regressions, where the \(\alpha\) parameter describes the mixing proportions. The mathematical representation of this model is given in this vignette (B√ºrkner 2017b).
To illustrate, I wrote a little function
rzoib() that takes these parameters as arguments, and generates
n random draws. Here is a histogram of 1k samples from four ZOIB distributions with various combinations of the parameters:
Figure 6: Four different ZOIB distributions resulting from various combinations of the parameters. (Parameter names are abbreviated; a = alpha, g = gamma, etc.)
Take the first (red) one. \(\alpha\) was set to zero, and therefore there are no observations exactly at zero or 1. Because \(\alpha = 0\), it doesn‚Äôt matter that \(\gamma\) was set to 0.5. \(\gamma\) is the conditional one probability, given that the observation was 0 or 1. Therefore, the first histogram only contains draws from a beta distribution with mean = 0.2, and precision = 6.
Next, take a look at the second (green) histogram. Here, \(\alpha = 0.1\), so 10% of the observations will be either 0 or 1. Of these 10%, 30% are ones (\(\gamma = 0.3\)). The bulk of the distribution, 90%, are draws from a beta distribution with a mean = 0.5, and precision = 3.
The bottom two histograms are two more combinations of the four parameters. Try to understand how their shapes are explained by the specific parameter combinations.
In summary, ZOIB is a reasonable model of slider scale data that can capture their major features, has support for the entire [0, 1] range of data, and does not assign density to impossible values (unlike the normal model). It also has an intuitive way of dealing with the boundary values as a separate process, thus providing more nuanced information about the outcome variable under study.
Next, we discuss a regression model with ZOIB as the data model: We are most interested in how other variables affect or relate to the outcome variables under study (slider scale ratings). By modeling the four parameters of the ZOIB model on predictors, ZOIB regression allows us to do just that.
In this example, we examine the ZOIB model in the context of one binary predictor variable (Group A vs B, a ‚Äúbetween subjects‚Äù manipulation).
To illustrate the ZOIB model in action, I simulated a data set of 100 ratings from two groups, A and B. These data are shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7: Simulated data set of two group‚Äôs slider scale ratings, with means and bootstrapped 95% CIs in blue. The ratings are jittered horizontally to reveal overlapping data points.
We are interested in the extent to which Group A‚Äôs ratings differ from Group B‚Äôs ratings. It is common practice to address this question with a t-test, treating the ratings as normally distributed within each group. I compared the two groups‚Äô means with a t-test: The difference was not statistically significant (B - A = 0.06, 95%CI = [-0.07, 0.2], p=0.340). I‚Äôve also heard that you can do something called a Mann-Whitney U test, or a Kruskal-Wallis test when you have a categorical predictor and don‚Äôt want to assume a parametric form for your outcomes. I tried those as well. Neither of these nonparametric tests were significant (p=0.226; p=0.225). I therefore concluded that I was unable to reject the null hypothesis that Group A and Group B‚Äôs population means are not different.
But as can be seen from Figure 2, the normal model makes unreasonable assumptions about these ratings. We see in Figure 7 that there are many non-normal features in this example data set; e.g. many values are bunched at 0.0 and 1.0. Let‚Äôs fit the ZOIB model on these data, and see if our conclusions differ. Spoiler alert: they do.
We will model the data as ZOIB, and use
group as a predictor of the mean and precision of the beta distribution, the zero-one inflation probability \(\alpha\), and the conditional one-inflation probability \(\gamma\). In other words, in this model
group may affect the mean and/or precision of the assumed beta distribution of the continuous ratings (0, 1), and/or the probability with which a binary rating is given, and/or the probability that a binary rating is 1. How do we estimate this model?
It might not come as a surprise that we estimate the model with bayesian methods, using the R package brms (B√ºrkner 2017b). Previously, I have discussed how to estimate signal detection theoretic models, ‚Äúrobust models,‚Äù and other multilevel models using this package. I‚Äôm a big fan of brms because of its modeling flexibility and post-processing functions: With concise syntax, you can fit a wide variety of possibly nonlinear, multivariate, and multilevel models, and analyze and visualize the models‚Äô results.
Let‚Äôs load the package, and start building our model.
The R formula syntax allows a concise representation of regression models in the form of
response ~ predictors. For a simple normal (i.e. gaussian) model of the mean of
Ratings as a function of
group, you could write
Ratings ~ group, family = gaussian. However, we want to predict the four parameters of the ZOIB model, and so will need to expand this notation.
The brms package allows modeling more than one parameter of an outcome distribution. Specifically, we want to predict so-called ‚Äúdistributional parameters,‚Äù and
bf() allows predicting them in their own formulas. Implicitly,
Ratings ~ group means that you want to model the mean of
Ratings on
group. Therefore, to model \(\phi\), \(\alpha\), and \(\gamma\), we will give them their own regression formulas within a call to
bf():
zoib_model <- bf( Rating ~ group, phi ~ group, zoi ~ group, coi ~ group, family = zero_one_inflated_beta() )
The four sub-models of our model are, in order of appearance: 1. the model of the beta distribution‚Äôs mean (read, ‚Äúpredict
Rating‚Äôs mean from
group‚Äù). Then, 2. the model of
phi; the beta distribution‚Äôs precision. 3.
zoi is the zero-one inflation (\(\alpha\)); that is, we model the probability of a binary rating as a function of
group. 4.
coi is the conditional one-inflation: Given that a response was {0, 1}, the probability of it being 1 is modelled on
group.
As is usual in R‚Äôs formula syntax, the intercepts of each of these formulas are implicitly included. (To make intercepts explicit, use e.g.
Rating ~ 1 + group.) Therefore, this model will have 8 parameters; the intercepts are Group A‚Äôs mean,
phi,
zoi, and
coi. Then, there will be a Group B parameter for each of them, indicating the extent to which the parameters differ for Group B versus Group A.
If
group has a positive effect on (the mean of)
Rating, we may conclude that the continuous rating‚Äôs mean differs as function of Group. On the other hand, if
coi is affected by
group, Group has an effect on the binary {0, 1} ratings. If group has no effects on any of the parameters, we throw up our hands and design a new study.
Finally, we specified
family = zero_one_inflated_beta(). Just like logistic regression, ZOIB regression is a type of generalized linear model. Therefore, each distributional parameter is modeled through a link function. The mean, zoi, and coi parameters are modeled through a logit link function. Phi is modeled through a log link function. These link functions can be changed by giving named arguments to
zero_one_inflated_beta(). It is important to keep in mind the specific link functions, we will need them when interpreting the model‚Äôs parameters.
To estimate this model, we pass the resulting
zoib_model to
brm(), with a data frame from the current R environment, 4 CPU cores for speed, and a file argument to save the resulting model to disk. The last two arguments are optional.
brms estimates the regression model using bayesian methods: It will return random draws from the parameters‚Äô posterior distribution. It takes less than a minute to draw samples from this model. Let‚Äôs then interpret the estimated parameters (i.e. the numerical summaries of the posterior distribution):
Family: zero_one_inflated_beta Links: mu = logit; phi = log; zoi = logit; coi = logit Formula: Rating ~ group phi ~ group zoi ~ group coi ~ group Data: dat (Number of observations: 100) Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1; total post-warmup samples = 4000 Population-Level Effects: Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS Intercept 0.33 0.16 0.03 0.64 1.00 5984 2997 phi_Intercept 1.49 0.24 1.00 1.92 1.00 5941 3217 zoi_Intercept -0.81 0.32 -1.45 -0.20 1.00 6959 3025 coi_Intercept 0.61 0.56 -0.44 1.76 1.00 5929 2712 groupB 0.91 0.21 0.50 1.30 1.00 6038 2969 phi_groupB 0.49 0.33 -0.14 1.12 1.00 5415 3211 zoi_groupB 0.09 0.42 -0.74 0.88 1.00 6376 2899 coi_groupB -0.85 0.75 -2.29 0.58 1.00 6368 2970 Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).
First, the summary of this model prints a paragraph of information about the model, such as the outcome family (ZOIB), link functions, etc. The regression coefficients are found under the ‚ÄúPopulation-Level Effects:‚Äù header. The columns of this section are ‚ÄúEstimate,‚Äù the posterior mean or point estimate of the parameter. ‚ÄúEst.Error,‚Äù the posterior standard deviation, or so called standard error of the parameter. Then, the lower and upper limit of the 95% Credible Interval. The two last columns are diagnostics of the model fitting procedure.
The first four rows of this describe the parameters for the baseline group (Group A).
Intercept is the logit-transformed mean of the beta distribution for Group A‚Äôs ratings (the subset of ratings that were (0, 1)). Next,
phi_Intercept describes the precision of the beta distribution fitted to Group A‚Äôs slider responses, on the scale of the (log) link function.
zoi_Intercept is the zero or one inflation of Group A‚Äôs data, on the logit scale.
coi_Intercept is the conditional one inflation; out of the 0 or 1 ratings in Group A‚Äôs data, describing the proportion of ones (out of the 0/1 responses)?
These parameters are described on the link scale, so for each of them, we can use the inverse link function to transform them to the response scale. Precision (
phi_Intercept) was modeled on the log scale. Therefore, we can convert it back to the original scale by exponentiating. For the other parameters, which were modeled on the logit scale, we can use the inverse, which is
plogis().
However, before converting the parameters, it is important to note that the estimates displayed above are summaries (means, quantiles) of the posterior draws of the parameters on the link function scale. Therefore, we cannot simply convert the summaries. Instead, we must transform each of the posterior samples, and then re-calculate the summaries. The following code accomplishes this ‚Äútransform-then-summarize‚Äù procedure for each of the four parameters:
posterior_samples(fit, pars = ""b_"")[,1:4] %>% mutate_at(c(""b_phi_Intercept""), exp) %>% mutate_at(vars(-""b_phi_Intercept""), plogis) %>% posterior_summary() %>% as.data.frame() %>% rownames_to_column(""Parameter"") %>% kable(digits = 2)
We can then interpret these summaries, beginning with
b_Intercept. This is the estimated mean of the beta distribution fitted to Group A‚Äôs (0, 1) rating scale responses (with its standard error, lower- and upper limits of the 95% CI). Then,
b_Phi_Intercept is the precision of the beta distribution.
zoi is the zero-one inflation, and
coi the conditional one inflation.
To make
b_zoi_Intercept concrete, we should be able to compare its posterior mean to the observed proportion of 0/1 values in the data:
Above we calculated the proportion of zeros and ones in the data set, and found that it matches the estimated value. Similarly, for
coi, we can find the corresponding value from the data:
Let‚Äôs get back to the model summary output. The following four parameters are the effects of being in group B on these parameters. Most importantly,
groupB is the effect of group B (versus group A) on the mean of the ratings‚Äô assumed beta distribution, in the logit scale. Immediately, we can see that the parameter‚Äôs 95% Credible Interval does not include zero. Traditionally, this parameter would be called ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù; group B‚Äôs (0, 1) ratings are on average greater than group A‚Äôs.
To transform this effect back to the data scale, we can again use
plogis(). However, it is important to keep in mind that the effect‚Äôs size on the original scale depends on the intercept, getting smaller as the intercept increases (just like in any other generalized linear model.) The following bit of code transforms this effect and its uncertainty back to the original scale.
Hypothesis Tests for class b: Hypothesis Estimate Est.Error CI.Lower CI.Upper Evid.Ratio Post.Prob Star 1 B - A 0.19 0.04 0.11 0.28 NA NA * --- 'CI': 90%-CI for one-sided and 95%-CI for two-sided hypotheses. '*': For one-sided hypotheses, the posterior probability exceeds 95%; for two-sided hypotheses, the value tested against lies outside the 95%-CI. Posterior probabilities of point hypotheses assume equal prior probabilities.
The data were simulated with the
rzoib() function, and I set \(\alpha = 0.25, \gamma = 0.5, \mu = 0.6 + 0.15\mbox{groupB}, \phi = 5\). Therefore, the results of the t-tests and nonparametric tests were misses; a true effect was missed. On the other hand, the ZOIB regression model detected the true effect of group on the beta distribution‚Äôs mean.
Finally, let‚Äôs visualize this key finding using the
conditional_effects() function from brms.
plot( conditional_effects(fit, dpar = ""mu""), points = TRUE, point_args = list(width = .05, shape = 1) )
Figure 8: Estimated mu parameters from the example ZOIB fit, as filled points and error bars (95% CIs), with the original data (empty circles).
Comparing Figure 8 to Figure 7 reveals the fundamental difference of the normal t-test model, and the ZOIB model: The ZOIB regression (8) has found a large difference between the continuous part of the slider ratings‚Äô means because it has treated the data with an appropriate model. By conflating the continuous and binary data, the t-test did not detect this difference.
In conclusion, this example showed that ZOIB results in more informative, and potentially more accurate, inferences from analog scale (‚Äúslider‚Äù) data. Of course, in this simulation we had the benefit of knowing the true state of matters: The data were simulated from a ZOIB model. Nevertheless, we have reasoned that by respecting the major features of slider scale data, the ZOIB is a more accurate representation of it, and was therefore able to detect a difference where the t-test did not. Next, I put this conjecture to a test by conducting a small simulation study.
To compare the performance of the t-test and ZOIB in a little bit more detail, I conducted a small simulation study. I simulated 100 data sets of 200 ratings from two independent groups, from the ZOIB model (100 ratings per group). I set \(\alpha = 0.2, \gamma = 0.7, \mu = 0.6 + 0.1\mbox{groupB}, \phi = 5\); that is, there was a small effect of group on the mean of the beta distribution, and all other parameters were constant across groups. A sample of the resulting data sets is shown in Figure 9
Figure 9: Six randomly selected simulated data sets. Points are individual ratings (jittered to show overlapping points), while blue symbols indicate the means and bootstrapped 95% CIs.
I first conducted an independent samples, unequal variances t-test on each of the 100 simulated data sets, comparing the two groups‚Äô mean ratings. 35% of these t-tests were significantly positive at the .05 level. That is, the power of the t-test in this simulation was about 35%. (Uncertainty in this value is moderate, because I only did 100 simulation runs.)
I then estimated the ZOIB model for each of the 100 simulated data sets. Statistical significance does not play a role in Bayesian statistics, but to most easily compare the results of these two models, I calculated the proportion of simulations for which the estimated Group on \(\mu\) effect‚Äôs 95% Credible Interval was entirely above zero. If a 95% CI does not include zero, disrespecting the philosophical differences of bayesian and frequentist statistics, I may say that the estimate is ‚Äúsignificant.‚Äù
This parameter was significantly greater than zero in 65% of the ZOIB models estimated on the same 100 simulated data sets. That is, the power of this model to detect an effect was much greater than the power of the t-test. These results are illustrated in Figure 10.
Figure 10: Results of the simulation study. Top: the estimated mean difference and 95% CI of the two groups‚Äô ratings, as estimated by a t-test. Red = not statistically significant; blue = statistically significant. The data sets are ordered on the x axis on the estimated mean difference. Bottom: simulation results of the ZOIB model. Same as the top panel, but the estimated parameter is the difference between the two group‚Äôs mu parameters of the beta distribution. (I back-transformed the mu parameter from the logit scale to the data scale to make the results numerically more comparable across the t-test and ZOIB models.) In both panels, the horizontal green line indicates the true effect used in the simulations.
As can be seen in this figure, in this particular setup, the t-tests severely underperformed in detecting a true effect when compared to the ZOIB model. Of course, this is to be expected, because the data were generated from the ZOIB model.
Out there in the wild, which of these models is closer to the true data generating process for slider scale ratings? Normal models, or ZOIB? (Or, most likely, some other class of models?) As we have seen, normal models may be poor representations of bounded and skewed slider scale data. It is therefore possible that the routine use of normal models in analyzing slider scale data can result in missing true effects at a rate higher than indicated by conventional power analyses.
I have not extensively reviewed the performance of the ZOIB model in this blog post. Neither did I analyze real slider scale data. Therefore, I can not and would not recommend exclusively favoring the ZOIB model over normal models for the analysis of slider scale data. However, I can recommend at least trying ZOIB for your own slider scale data, and thinking about what models might best fit your data if they appear non normal.
There are many limitations to the current discussion, and the simulation studies should be considerably expanded to more realistic and variable situations.
One limitation of the ZOIB model might be what I here discussed as its main benefit. ZOIB separates the binary and continuous processes, such that a predictor‚Äôs effect on one or both of them are independent in the model. However, it is likely that these two processes are somehow correlated. Thus, ZOIB does not give only one ‚Äúeffect‚Äù of a predictor on the ratings, but two, one for the continuous part, and one for the binary. By not getting a single effect, if nothing else, the model is more complex and probably more difficult to analyze and/or explain.
The beta regression model has previously been discussed as a reasonable model of data in the open (0, 1) interval (Ferrari and Cribari-Neto 2004). It‚Äôs application in psychological studies has also been discussed by (Smithson and Verkuilen 2006; see also Verkuilen and Smithson 2012). These earlier papers recommended that values at the 0 and 1 boundaries be somehow transformed to make the data suitable for the model, but transforming the data such that a model can be fitted seems like a bad idea.
Mixtures of beta and discrete models were discussed by Ospina and Ferrari (2008), and an R package for estimation of the ZOIB model was introduced by Liu and Kong (2015). Liu and Eugenio (2018) found that ZOIB models are better estimated with Bayesian methods than with maximum likelihood methods.
More information about the brms package can be found in B√ºrkner (2017b), and in the excellent vignettes at.
The following software packages were used: R [Version 4.0.3; R Core Team (2020)] and the R-packages brms [Version 2.15.0; B√ºrkner (2017a); B√ºrkner (2018)], broom [Version 0.7.5.9000; Robinson, Hayes, and Couch (2021)], dplyr [Version 1.0.5; Wickham et al.

Faculty Strike at
Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education
On October 19, 2016, thousands of faculty and coaches at the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE), represented by the Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties (APSCUF), went out on strike throughout the university system.
The strike constitutes the largest faculty strikes in many years in higher education, and the first at PASSHE. In the past year, f
aculty union members at two other major university systems voted to authorize strikes but those strikes were averted after the parties were able to settle upon the terms of successor agreements. In 2016, there have also been faculty strikes at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, City College of San Francisco, and Green River College.
Saint Xavier University: NEA Certified to Represent Adjunct Unit
St. Xaiver University
, NLRB Case No.
13-RC-022025
On September 29, 2016, the NLRB certified NEA as the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit of approximately 122 non-tenure track faculty at Saint Xavier University following a representation election. The faculty voted in 29-25 in favor of union representation. The recent certification took place over five years after the representation petition was filed. The delay was due to the school's unsuccessful litigated efforts to persuade the NLRB to decline jurisdiction over the question of representation because the school is religiously affiliated.
The following is the composition of the newly certified faculty unit:
Included: All part-time faculty employed by the Employer at its campuses presently located at 3700 West 103rd Street, Chicago, Illinois and 18230 Orland Parkway, Orland Park, Illinois, who teach at least three credit hours per semester.
Excluded: All part-time faculty while teaching coursework in the Pastoral Ministry Institute and members in the School of Nursing, all part-time faculty teaching in the Department of Religious Studies, all music tutors, all student supervisors in the School of Education, independent contractors, confidential employees and managers, office clerical employees and guards, professional employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.

Univ. of Minnesota: SEIU Petition for Twin Cities Unit Moves Forward
University of Minnesota
, Unit 8, BMS Case No. 16PCE0644
Following a lengthy hearing, the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services Commissioner Josh Tilson issued a decision on September 20, 2016 concerning the composition of a faculty unit at the University of Minnesota's Twin Cities Campus that SEIU seeks to represent.
The Minnesota public sector collective bargaining statute defines the composition of bargaining units at the University of Minnesota. Among the bargaining units are four units for instructional staff, graduate assistants, and academic, professional and administrative staff. The statute concerning the Twins Cities faculty unit states:
(8) The Twin Cities Instructional Unit consists of the positions of all instructional employees with the rank of professor, associate professor, assistant professor, including research associate or instructor, including research fellow, located on the Twin Cities campuses.
The issue determined by Commissioner Tilsen issued was whether the following titles belonged in the Twin Cities Institutional Unit: Assistant Extension Educator, Assistant Extension Professor, Associate Extension Educator, Associate Extension Professor, Extension Educator, Extension Professor, Lecturer, Teaching Specialist, Senior Lecturer and Senior Teaching Specialist.
In his decision, Commissioner Tilsen concluded that the classifications of Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Teaching Specialist, and Senior Specialist belonged in the unit because they are located on the Twin Cities Campus. The other titles were excluded because a majority of the employees in each title are not located on the Twin Cities Campus.
Unless the administrative decision is successfully challenged in court, an election will be scheduled concerning the following unit at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus:
The Twin Cities Instructional Unit consists of the positions of all instructional employees with the rank of professor, associate professor, assistant professor, including research associate or instructor, including research fellow, located on the Twin Cities Campus: Tenure Track: Professors, Regents Professors, Associate Professors, Assistant Professor; Non-Tenure Track: Professors, Adjunct Professors, Adjunct Research Professor, Research Professors, Visiting Professors, Associate Professors, Adjunct Associate Professors, Research Associate Professors, Teaching Associate Professors, Visiting Associate Professors, Assistant Professors, Adjunct Assistant Professors, Research Assistant Professors, Teaching Assistant Professors, Visiting Assistant professor, Instructors, Adjunct Instructors, Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Teaching Specialist, and Senior Teaching Specialist.
Minneapolis Coll. of Art & Design: FT and PT Faculty Vote to Unionize
Minneapolis College of Art and Design
, NLRB Case No. 18-RC-182546
On September 20, 2016, the NLRB Region 18 Director issued a uniting
decision
and the direction of an election concerning a representation petition filed by SEIU that sought to represent a combined unit of full-time and part-time non-tenure track faculty at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.
Full-time faculty at the college include ranked faculty, full-time ranked pro-rata faculty and visiting faculty. The full-time faculty are not tenure eligible but cannot be terminated without just cause. They are subject to one-year, three-year or five year contracts with most having five-year contracts. The Regional Director found that full-time faculty obtain ""quasi-tenure"" when they become full professors and are entitled to renewable five-year contracts. Adjunct faculty teach a maximum of 12 credits over a 12-month rolling period, and are not entitled to just cause protections.
In his decision, the Regional Director rejected the college's argument that the approximate 35 full-time faculty members are managerial, finding that the college failed to meet its burden of proof of demonstrating faculty control over the primary and secondary areas set forth in
Pacific Lutheran University
, 361 NLRB No. 157 (2014).
The Regional Director, however, concluded that the full-time faculty and the approximate 80-100 part-time faculty should be in separate bargaining units. His decision was premised on prior precedent holding that tenured and tenure-track faculty should be in a unit apart from non-tenure track faculty. He found that separate units at Minneapolis College of Art and Design were appropriate because the two faculty do not share a mutuality of interest due to the following differences: compensation; participation in college government; full-time faculty's eligibility for ""quasi- tenure""; and working conditions.
The following are the at-issue bargaining units found to be appropriate:
Part-Time Unit
Included: All part-time faculty who teach undergraduate or graduate-level credit-earning courses or labs at the Employer's campus located at 2501 Stevens Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota, including but not limited to faculty holding the titles of Adjunct Faculty or Adjunct Professor.
Excluded: All full-time faculty, including ranked faculty holding the titles of Assistant Professor, Associate Professor or Full Professor, pro-rata ranked faculty and visiting faculty;.
Full-Time Unit
Included: All full-time faculty who teach undergraduate or graduate-level credit-earning courses or labs at the Employer's campus located at 2501 Stevens Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota, including ranked faculty holding the titles of Assistant Professor, Associate Professor or Full Professor, pro-rata ranked faculty and visiting faculty.
Excluded: All part-time faculty including those holding the titles of Adjunct Faculty or Adjunct Professor;.
On October 19, 2016, the NLRB Region 18 Office tallied the ballots.
The part-time faculty voted 43 to 20 in favor of unionization and the full-time faculty voted 16 to 13 in favor of union representation.
Augsberg College: SEIU Files to Represent FT-PT Bargaining Unit
Augsburg College
, NLRB Case No.
18-RC-186094
On October 13, 2016, SEIU filed a representation petition seeking to represent approximately 260 full-time and part-time contingent faculty employed by Augsburg College in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The following is the proposed at-issue unit:
Included: All non-tenure track full-time and regular part-time faculty who teach undergraduate or graduate-level credit-earning courses or labs (including but not limited to the following titles: instructor, studio artist, or publishing mentors) on the Minneapolis campus located at 2211 Riverside Avenue, Minneapolis, MN 55454
Excluded: All administrators (including Deans, directors, provosts and chairs who may have teaching assignments); Graduate Students (including those teaching courses in addition to being paid a stipend); all other employees at Augsburg College (including those who teach a class or course and are separately compensated for such teaching); managers, confidential employees, office clerical employees, guards, and supervisors as defined by the Act.
Seattle University: SEIU Certified to Represent Adjunct Unit; University to
Challenge NLRB's Assertion of Jurisdiction
Seattle University,
NLRB Case No.
19-RC-122863
On September 26, 2016, SEIU was certified as the exclusive representative of the following unit of 199 non-tenure track faculty at Seattle University:
Included: All non-tenure-eligible faculty employed by the Employer, including but not limited to all non-tenure-track instructors, senior instructors, adjunct faculty, senior adjuncts, lecturers, senior lecturers, legacy titles including but not limited to visiting professors, visiting assistant professors, and core lecturers;
Excluded: All faculty teaching in the College of Nursing, all faculty teaching in the School of Law, all non-tenure eligible faculty in the Department of Theology and Religious Studies and in the School of Theology and Ministry, all other employees, professors emeritus, tenure-track and tenured faculty, administrative faculty, full-time staff who are not compensated additionally for teaching, administrators, department administrators, program coordinators, program directors, directors, clinical professor series, library faculty, research faculty, research scientists/scholars, post-doctoral scholars/fellows, truly visiting faculty, distinguished professors, professors in residence, endowed chairs, campus clergy, deans, associate deans, department chairs, campus safety personnel, lab assistants, graduate assistants, teaching assistants, managers, guards, and supervisors as defined in the Act.
The certification follows the August 23, 2016
decision
by the NLRB Board affirming the agency's assertion of jurisdiction over contingent faculty at the religiously-affiliated school, and the September 12, 2016 tally of ballots. The tally demonstrated that the faculty voted 73-63 in favor of union representation with additional 4 ballots challenged.
On September 30, 2016 Seattle University President Father Stephen V. Sundborg
announced
the university's intent to seek judicial review of the NLRB's assertion of jurisdiction over the faculty representation question on First Amendment grounds.
State College of Florida Board of Trustees: FT Faculty Vote to Unionize
State College of Florida Board of Trustees,
FPERC Case No. EL-2016-022
On October 5, 2016, the Florida Public Employees Relations Commission (FPERC) verified the election results concerning a representation petition filed by the United Faculty of Florida (UFF) seeking to represent a full-time faculty unit at the State College of Florida Board of Trustees. Of the approximate 107 faculty members eligible to vote, 75 voted in favor of union representation, and 24 voted against.
As a result of the election FPERC certified UFF as the exclusive representative of the following bargaining unit:
Included: All full-time employees in the lower division position classifications of instructor, associate professor, assistant professor, and professor.
Excluded: All other employees of the State College of Florida Board of Trustees including program directors, librarians, advisors, department chairs, all employees of the Collegiate School, all faculty in the baccalaureate program, and all confidential and managerial employees.
Ivy Tech CC: Adjunct Faculty's Sexual Orientation Claim to be Reviewed
Hively v. Ivy Tech Community
College, Case N o. 15-1720 (7th Cir. 2016)
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued an
order
on October 11, 2016 granting a petition for rehearing en banc and vacating a decision affirming the dismissal of a discrimination claim filed by adjunct faculty member Kimberly Hively against Ivy Tech Community College under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In her lawsuit, Hively alleges that she was discriminated against by the college because of her sexual orientation when she was rejected for full-time positions. In July, a three-member panel of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of Hively's claim based on prior precedent holding that sexual orientation is not a protected class under Title VII. The recent order granting a rehearing en banc means that the prior precedent will be reexamined by a panel composed of all the judges of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
